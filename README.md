o7 all, 

I got tired of manually setting destos on all multiboxed toons. Also, at the same time, I thought - wouldn't it be sweet if you could set destos for all your friends on a NS roam? This would reduce confusion and not wanting to get "left behind".

With the rise of AI assisted coding and my want to learn coding in general, I spent a few days creating this app. 

Please feel free add any comments/suggestions/improvements here on GitHub or over on discord (JonnyGuns)

Hope you enjoy using this app as much as I enjoyed "coding" it. :^>

Take care, 

Jonny Guns o7
